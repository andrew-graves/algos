# Algorithms

### This repository contains a smattering of algorithms commonly used in data science. These were written for learning purposes, rather than for application.

Some examples include: 

- Heapsort (see *heap_sort.py* in *cs*)
- Value iteration (see *dyn_prog.py* in *rl*)
- Newton's optimization method (see *log_reg* in *stats*)
- etc...
